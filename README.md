# Netflix Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
Netflix Movie Recommendation System is a project designed to create an efficient recommendation system for movies using content-based filtering and sentiment analysis. The project focuses on leveraging data from diverse sources, including movie metadata, Wikipedia, and sentiment analysis of user reviews.

The primary goal is to develop a recommendation system that offers personalized movie suggestions based on attributes like genres, directors, and actors. Using content-based filtering and sentiment analysis techniques, the system aims to provide accurate movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and historical interactions.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
  - Gathering movie metadata from various CSV files and web scraping Wikipedia for additional details.
  - Cleaning, formatting, and merging data to create a comprehensive movie dataset.

- **Content-Based Filtering:**
  - Employing content-based filtering to suggest movies based on similarity in attributes like genres, directors, and actors.

- **Sentiment Analysis:**
  - Using sentiment analysis techniques to analyze user reviews and enhance movie recommendations.

- **Flask-based Web Application:**
  - Implementing a user-friendly web interface using Flask to interact with the recommendation system.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Flask for web application
- BeautifulSoup for web scraping
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for sentiment analysis
